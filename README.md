# README

In order to organize CRUD-related views more efficiently and concisely, I tried to use [DRF ViewSets](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/) instead of [the official class-based views of Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/class-based-views/intro/).

It turned out to be good, or at least a good fit for my needs.
